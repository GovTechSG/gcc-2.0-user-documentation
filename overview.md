# About Cloud Management portal

[GCC 2.0](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/overview-of-gcc-version-2/#/) has a Cloud Management portal(CMP) which is a web-based console for agencies to centrally manage their GCC 2.0 tenant accounts, cloud accounts and their users. While public officers onboarded to GCC 2.0 can request for tenant and cloud accounts using CMP, authorised users can manage these accounts and their users from CMP.

## Supported devices
- Non-SE GSIB devices
- Government Managed Device

>**Note:** For more information about these devices, refer to the [GCC glossary](glossary).

**Prerequisites to access CMP:**

From your non-SE GSIB device, go to [TechPass portal](https://portal.techpass.gov.sg/) and sign up for [TechPass account](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/#/onboard-public-officers-using-non-se-machines). If you need to access CMP from the agency provided internet device, request SEED provisioning while signing up for TechPass.
