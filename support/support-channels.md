# Support channels

Please refer to [GCC 2.0 support channels](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/overview-of-gcc-version-2/#/support) to know when to use ITSM project to raise incident and service requests for GCC 2.0.

Agencies that wish to onboard to GCC 2.0 will need a GCC 2.0 project on ITSM. This is needed for your GCC 2.0 users to raise incident and service requests.
